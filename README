vorb-dbg is a new open source debugger written in C++ for linux. 
It uses ptrace and has no dependencies. To compile, just run:

  ./compile

It is currently designed for 32-bit systems but once it is more
stable I will add 64-bit support. To run:

  dev@crunchbang-dev:~/vorb-dbg$ ./debugger 
  Usage: ./debugger [option] [options]
   -a/--attach <pid> -- attach to process
   -c/--create <create process> <process arguments> -- create process
   -h/--help -- display this message
  dev@crunchbang-dev:~/vorb-dbg$
